<h2># Patient Health Data Analysis</h2>
<br>
Accurately predicting critical health parameters is essential for effective patient care. In this project, we focus on key medical data points, including: <br>
<br>
- Temperature Data <br>
- ECG Data  <br>
- Pressure Dat<br>
- Diabetes Prediction<br>

To enhance our understanding, we use visualizations and plots for Temperature, ECG, and Pressure data. These insights help analyze trends and potential health risks. <br>
<br>
### Data Source <br> 
The dataset used in this analysis is obtained from the following source:  <br>
[Diabetes Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv)  
<br>
This project aims to improve predictive analysis for better healthcare outcomes.  <br>
